Outlaw Economy - Usage Guide
============================

This document walks administrators and players through the everyday workflows of the Outlaw Economy plugin.

1. First Launch Checklist (Administrators)
-----------------------------------------
1. Upload the plugin JAR to `plugins/` and start the server once so the configuration files are generated.
2. Edit `plugins/OutlawEconomy/config.yml` if you want a different starting balance or currency name, then restart the server.
3. Give yourself the `outlawecoadmin` permission (or OP) to manage shops and player balances.
4. If you use Vault, make sure Vault and any dependent plugins are loaded before the server finishes booting.

2. Managing Player Money (Administrators)
-----------------------------------------
- Check a balance: `/balance <player>`
- List every stored balance: `/balance all`
- Add funds: `/givemoney <player> <amount>`
- Remove funds: `/removemoney <player> <amount>`
- Send money as a player: `/pay <player> <amount>`

3. Setting Up NPC Shops
-----------------------
1. Stand where you want the NPC to appear.
2. Run `/shop create <template>` to spawn a shop NPC using an existing template.
3. Use `/shop list` to see currently placed NPCs and confirm the creation.
4. To remove an NPC, look at it and run `/shop remove`.
5. Adjust item offerings and prices with the admin subcommands:
   - `/shop add itemshop <template> <item> <quantity> <buyPrice> [sellPrice]`
   - `/shop removeitem <template> <item>`
   - `/shop reloadtemplates`
   - `/shop setting price`
   - `/shop setting overallprice <template> [buy|sell] <multiplier|reset>`

4. Opening Shops for Players
----------------------------
- Grant players the `outlaweco.use` permission so they can interact with shop NPCs.
- Optionally give specific staff the `outlaweco.command.shopopen` permission to run `/shop open <template>` or `/shop open general` directly from chat.
- Integrate with NPC plugins (for example FancyNPC) by executing `shop open %player% <template>` as the NPC's command.

5. Using the General Marketplace (Players)
-----------------------------------------
1. Interact with the general market NPC or run `/shop open general` (permission required) to open the menu.
2. Drag the item stack from your cursor onto the sell button to begin a listing.
3. Enter a price at or below 25,000. Prices above the cap are rejected and your item is returned to you automatically.
4. Confirm the listing to post it for sale.
5. Browse available listings, click an entry to purchase, and confirm.

6. Trading Safely with Other Players
-----------------------------------
1. Run `/trade <player>` to send a trade request. The request expires after the configured timeout (default 30 seconds).
2. The target can accept with `/trade accept`, decline with `/trade deny`, or you can cancel with `/trade cancel`.
3. Once both players are in the trade menu:
   - Place items into your offer slots.
   - Use the buttons to adjust the money amount you are offering.
   - Click the confirm button when satisfied.
4. The trade completes automatically when both players confirm with sufficient balances.

7. Handling Rapid Earnings Alerts (Staff)
----------------------------------------
- The plugin monitors player profits. If someone earns 20,000 or more within five minutes, the staff chat receives an alert and you can teleport to investigate.

8. Best Practices
-----------------
- Regularly back up `balances.yml` and `shops.yml` along with your world data.
- Keep a test server to validate template changes before applying them to production.
- Communicate the 25k listing limit to players so they understand why an expensive listing might be rejected.
